Hacktober is Digital Ocean's Annual Event that encourages people to contribute to Open Source throughout October. Much of Modern Tech Infrastructure - including some of Digital Ocean's own Products - Relies on Open Source projects built and maintained by passionate people. Hacktober is all about giving back to those projects, sharpening skills, and celebrating all things and open source, especially the people that make open source so special.

To contribute Firstly, you need to have a local repository for your actual project code. (If you already have this, then follow the procedure) Open the command line ("Terminal" on the Mac, "Git Bash" on Windows) and change into your project's base directory. There, you can create a new Git repository:
